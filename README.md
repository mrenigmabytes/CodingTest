Coding Test for Junior-MidLevel Applicants
The text file in this repo describes the typical test I am now using for Junior-MidLevel Applicants.
I use it as a 1 hr whiteboard test. 
I dont really expect the candidates to finish the whole ask and there are many ways to solve the problem.
This test, in essence, is a very simplified minimalist version of the bread and butter problems one will face during their day to day routines as developers.
Ideally the candidates ask questions as to system limits etc. You should create your own... be creative.
I dont tell the candidates what I'm looking for, but the problem implies the following which are quite trivial nowadays:
*data structures
*prioritization/scheduling
*multithreading
*concurrency
*searching/sorging ( different load sizes have better sorting/searching algorithms)
*IO
*RestServices
*IPC
*DesignPatterns
*Optimization/Efficiency

There are many ways to solve the problem... and the limits imposed on the system can dicate how the problem is approached.
